# Farmer Flow Chain

An innovative blockchain-based platform to streamline and enhance the agricultural supply chain, empowering farmers, buyers, and stakeholders with trust, transparency, and efficiency.

## Overview

Farmer Flow Chain utilizes Hyperledger Fabric to create a secure, decentralized ledger that tracks the movement and provenance of agricultural products from farm to end consumer. This project was developed as a hackathon entry to solve pressing social and logistical challenges in Indian agriculture by leveraging blockchain technology.

## Features

- **Transparent Supply Chain:** Immutable tracking of farm produce for enhanced trust.
- **User-friendly Interfaces:** Simplified interaction for farmers, buyers, and regulators.
- **Secure Transactions:** Encrypted and verifiable transactions on the blockchain.
- **Automated Workflows:** Smart contracts for automating agreements and payments.
- **Decentralized Data Ownership:** Farmers maintain control over their data and produce information.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Built using Hyperledger Fabric to support growing transactions.

## Hackathon Focus

- Tackles real-world problems for Indian farmers such as supply chain inefficiencies and lack of fair pricing.
- Demonstrates integration of blockchain with front-end and back-end systems.
- Showcases encryption techniques and secure user registration.
- Emphasizes practical usability and social impact rather than just technical novelty.
- Designed as a proof-of-concept with potential for real-world deployment.

   ```

2. **Set Up Node Environment**
   (Use Node Version Manager to switch Node versions)
   ```
   nvm install 8
   nvm use 8
   ```

3. **Install Hyperledger Composer CLI (If using Composer)**
